# Analysis

1. Scanned using nmap using the following commands shown below. Once the scan completed noticed the http server was running Apache 2.4.41. <img width="1707" height="756" alt="Screenshot from 2025-08-08 09-34-52" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2413ca55-fca2-492f-a069-02da5e24fca8" />

2. Going to a browser I input the IP address and see a notice: <img width="1707" height="756" alt="Screenshot from 2025-08-08 09-38-08" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c02a10c2-1715-45df-a49d-6242659e7e49" />

3. In this website I checked the page source code to find anything of interest. Surely enough we have found a note 
<img width="1713" height="863" alt="Screenshot from 2025-08-08 09-38-44" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2efaf455-de86-4abf-8739-106c2bcd1162" />

4. If we check the directory mentioned in the note from the source code we can redirect to the `<IP address>/dev`, unforunately I got a not found link. <img width="1713" height="863" alt="Screenshot from 2025-08-08 09-39-43" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/021ffb58-be75-4bb0-ae73-4b25359ba0ff" />

5. Next thing to try is to find if there are any valid directories. To do this I used DirBuster using the file directory-list-2.3.-medium.txt on the IP address we have. <img width="1401" height="989" alt="Screenshot from 2025-08-08 09-43-41" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6a5938ae-18fc-4221-bc4d-5aa2b44ce8ba" />

6. After DirBuster has ran I found a directory `/development`.

7. Redirecting to this location we can see two text files. <img width="1634" height="1124" alt="Screenshot from 2025-08-08 09-45-13" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c68bd59c-4854-4cc8-be1d-12624df49f09" />

8. Reading through both of these, we can see two users talking to each other with the initials of K and J. <img width="1634" height="1124" alt="Screenshot from 2025-08-08 09-45-38" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e85c987f-a64e-4671-9df5-dbe0092457cb" />

9. To find out more I’ll try using enum4linux, which is can be used to gather information from a system such as user accounts, shared folders and share password policies. To run enum4linux I opened up the applications and looked for the enum4linux application icon. From there opening terminal we use the command: <br />
       `enum4linux.pl -a <IP Address>`  
        ◦ the “-a” function will attempt all the simple enumerations such as:
            ▪     -U       get userlist
            ▪     -M       get machine list*
            ▪     -S       get sharelist
            ▪     -P       get password policy information
            ▪     -G       get group and member list
            ▪     -d       be detailed, applies to -U and -S
